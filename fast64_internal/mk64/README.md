# Mario Kart 64

## Importing Course
It's similar to the F3D Importer, you select the file where you have the display list, set the name of the display list you want to import and the path to the decomp. (by default courses are split in segments so it's better to use the cinematic version, usually the last display list in course_data.inc.c).

Example of configuration:
- d_course_wario_stadium_dl_CA78
- path/to/mk64/courses/wario_stadium/course_data.inc.c
- path/to/mk64
