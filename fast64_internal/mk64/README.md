# Mario Kart 64

## Importing Course
It's similar to F3D Importer, you select the file where you have the display list, the name of the display list you want to import and the path to the decomp. (by default course are cut as segment so it's better to use cinematic version who have all, it's in general the last display variable in course_data.inc.c).

Example of configuration:
- d_course_wario_stadium_dl_CA78
- path/to/mk64/courses/wario_stadium/course_data.inc.c
- path/to/mk64
