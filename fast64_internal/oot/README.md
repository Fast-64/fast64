# Ocarina Of Time

### Getting Started
1. In the 3D view properties sidebar, go to the ``Fast64`` tab, then ``Fast64 Global Settings`` and set ``Game`` to ``OOT``.
2. Set ``F3D Microcode`` to ``F3DEX2/LX2``.
3. Switch to the ``OOT`` tab. In ``OOT File Settings``, set your decomp path to the path of your [OoT Decomp](https://github.com/zeldaret/oot/) repository on disk.
4. In ``OOT Tools``, click "Add Scene" to create a basic scene.
5. In ``OOT Scene Exporter`` you can choose the scene to replace or add. Some scenes have some hardcoded things that will cause them to break, so choose something like ``Market Entrance (Child Day) (Entra)``.
- To add a custom scene choose ``Custom`` in the scene search box, then choose in which folder you want to export the scene and which name you want it to be (note that Fast64 will force the scene name to be lower-case).
6. Make sure you selected the right scene in ``Scene Object`` then click "Export Scene" to export it. When you click ``Add Scene`` this is set automatically.
7. Compile and run the game. This was tested for commit ef56b01.
8. (Optional) In the ``View`` tab you may want to increase the ``Clip End`` value.
9. Note: You can enable ``Export as Single File`` if you want to have your scene in the same format as the other ones in decomp.
10. Note: You can read [this code](https://github.com/Dragorn421/oot/tree/mod_base_for_mods) to take a glance at what you can do for quality of life for testing.

### Scene Overview
In Blender, the "empty" object type is used to define different types of OOT data, including scenes and rooms.
For scenes, there must be a specific parenting hierarchy:

![](/images/oot_scene_hierarchy.png)

This means that any geometry/actors/etc. not parented to the scene hierarchy will NOT be included in the export.
Note that geometry/actors/etc. do not have to be directly parented to the room empty, as long as its in a descendant's hierachy somewhere. Cutscene empty objects needs to be parented to nothing.

Properties for empties/meshes can be found in the Blender object properties window.

Read the "Getting Started" section for information on scene exporting.

### Actors
To add an actor you need to create a new empty object in Blender, the shape doesn't matter.
When the empty object is created you can set the ``Actor`` object type in the ``Object Properties`` panel.

To add actors to a scene, create a new Empty and parent it to a Room, otherwise they will not be exported in the room C code. Then in the Object Properties panel select ``Actor`` as the Object Type. Use the ``Select Actor ID`` button to choose an actor, and then set the Actor Parameter value as desired (see the list of Actor Parameters below). 

Finally, every actors you are using needs their assets. In OoT they're called "Objects", if an actor is missing an object the code will not spawn the actor. To do this select the Room that your actor is parented to, select the "Objects" tab in its Object Properties window, and click "Add Item". 

Then "Search Object ID" to find the actor object you need. For example, if adding a Deku Baba actor (EN_DEKUBABA) you need to add the "Dekubaba" object to the Room's object dependencies. Note that the object list must not contain more than 15 items.

#### Actor Parameters
Actor parameters can be found at https://wiki.cloudmodding.com/oot/Actor_List_(Variables). This documentation is NOT 100% accurate, you can get more informations with the OoT Decomp. Look for ``rot.z`` and ``params`` in the actor you want, some actors may use ``rot.x`` and ``rot.y``.

### Exits
The debug menu scene select can be found at ``SceneSelectEntry sScenes[]`` in ``src/overlays/gamestates/ovl_select/z_select.c``.
The last field of a ``SceneSelectEntry`` is the index into ``gEntranceTable`` (found in ``src/code/z_scene_table.c``).
All exits are basically an index into this table. Due to the way it works it makes it difficult to add/remove entries without breaking everything. For now the user will have to manually manage this table. For more info check out https://wiki.cloudmodding.com/oot/Entrance_Table.

### Scene Draw Configuration And Dynamic Material Properties
The scene object has a property called ``Draw Config``. This is an index into ``sSceneDrawHandlers`` in ``src/code/z_scene_table.c``.
Each function in this table will load certain Gfx commands such as scrolling textures or setting color registers into the beginning of a RAM segment using ``gsSPSegment()``. In Blender, in the material properties window you can choose which commands are called at the beginning of the material drawing. For example, to get animated water you need to use segment 9 with the draw config 19 (0x13).

![](/images/oot_dynamic_material.png)

Note that there are different segments loaded between the OPA (opaque) and XLU (transparent) draw layers.
Additionally, for functions like ``Gfx_TexScroll()``, the x,y inputs are pre-shifted by <<2. For example, a % 128 means a repeat of the texture every 32 pixels.

### Collision
Collision properties are found underneath the material properties. Water boxes and collision properties will have references the properties "Camera", "Lighting", and "Exit", which reference the indices of the scene cameras, scene light list, and scene exit list respectively. If you want separate visual/collision geometry, you can set per mesh object "Ignore Collision" or "Ignore Render" in object inspector window.

### Skeletons And Animations
For bones, there are 3 bone types: Default, Custom DL, and Ignore. This can be set in the bone properties window.
Default is a regular deformation bone. Ignore will not be handled by the exporter/importer. Custom DL lets you define the name of a DL that you want a bone to draw instead of drawing geometry from the armature. There is also an option for billboarding the specific geometry associated with the bone.

The armature properties window also has the option to set a LOD armature. This armature must have the same bone structure as your current armature.

To export a skeletal mesh, select an armature and then click "Export" for the armature exporter. Make sure there is only one bone without a parent (the root bone), as the exporter will choose the first parentless bone as the start bone of the armature.

To import a skeletal mesh, just click "Import" for the armature importer. You may encounter a couple issues:

![](/images/oot_imported_gerudo_textured.png)
![](/images/oot_imported_gerudo_solid.png)


1. Eye/face textures are black: Texture pointers which are set dynamically will not be imported. Instead, the name of the pointer will be used instead of the actual data.
2. Certain colors are white/different: Some graphical effects are achieved through dynamic Gfx commands, such as tinting white textures. These effects will not be imported.
3. Strange imported normals: Due to the behaviour of rotating vertices on a skinned triangle that differs between Blender and the N64, normals may look strange. Note that these normals will look correct if re exported back into the game (assuming the rest pose is not changed).

Note that rest pose rotations are zeroed out on export, so you can modify the rest pose of imported armature while still preserving its structure. You can do this by using the "Apply As Rest Pose" operator under the Fast64 tab. Note that imported animations however still require the imported rest pose to work correctly.

There may also be an issue where some meshes import completely black due to the assumption that the F3D cycle mode is set to 2-Cycle, when it should really be 1-Cycle. Try changing the cycle type to 1-Cycle in cases where a dynamic texture pointer is not expected.

To import an animation, select the armature the animation belongs to then click "Import" on the animation importer.
To export an animation, select an armature and click "Export", which will export the active animation of the armature.

### Creating a Cutscene
**Creating the cutscene itself:**

To create custom cutscenes you need to get [zcamedit, made by Sauraen](https://github.com/sauraen/zcamedit).

1. Start with using the ``Add Cutscene`` button from the OOT Panel. Name it ``Cutscene.YOUR_CS_NAME``, ``YOUR_CS_NAME`` being the name of your choice, it can be something like: ``Cutscene.fireTempleIntroCS``. Note that this object can't be parented to any object.
2. Select the cutscene empty object, then in the ``Object Properties`` panel click on ``Init Cutscene Empty``, then ``Create camera shot``. This will initialise the cutscene and add a basic camera shot with 4 bones.
3. Select the scene where you want to add the cutscene, and in the object properties go in the ``Cutscene`` tab then enable ``Write Cutscene``. In ``Data`` select ``Object`` and in ``Cutscene Object`` select the cutscene empty object you just created.
4. Now you need to create the camera shot. The ``Create camera shot`` button from the cutscene object's properties panel will add a basic shot that you can edit. To have a better idea of the position/angle of one point of the shot, you can change the display of the armature in the ``Object Data Properties`` panel (select the shot object first), choose ``Octahedral`` in ``Viewport Display`` then ``Display As``.
5. As mentioned in the zcamedit repository, the first and last bone of the shot won't be actual camera points, it defines the start and the end of a cutscene, this means with the basic shot you'll have only 2 actual camera points. Either duplicate (``SHIFT+D``) or add a new bone to add more camera points.
6. You can edit the position and rotation of each bone in the ``Edit Mode`` after selecting the shot object. The "tail" (less large point) of a bone is the direction, and "head" (larger point) is the origin.
7. When you're done with your cutscene, start with exporting your scene (you don't need to export it everytime). When this is done, select the cutscene object you want to export and use ``Export Cutscene`` from ``OOT Cutscene Exporter`` in the OOT panel. In the ``File`` field, you can choose the scene of your choice (note that it can export into actors too).
8. Compile the game.

To get more informations about the game's cutscene system/camera system, read [zcamedit's readme](https://github.com/sauraen/zcamedit#setting-up-a-cutscene)

Note: a "cutscene terminator" is a cutscene command that makes a scene transition. For example, this is used in the intro cutscene or in the credits.

**Watching the cutscene in-game**

To be able to actually watch your cutscene you need to have a way to trigger it, this can be done by an actor (for instance) or using the entrance cutscene table. This guide will be explaining how to use an entrance.

1. Open ``src/code/z_demo.c`` and add an ``#include`` with the path of the file containing your cutscene.
2. Add an entry at the end of ``EntranceCutscene sEntranceCutsceneTable[]``, the format is:
``{ ENTRANCE_NUMBER, AGE_RESTRICTION, FLAG, SEGMENT_ADDRESS }``
- ``ENTRANCE_NUMBER`` is the entrance index in ``gEntranceTable``
- ``AGE_RESTRICTION`` defines if you want to play your cutscene only as child (set it to 1), as adult (set it to 0) or both (set it to 2)
- ``FLAG`` is the ``event_chk_inf`` flag that will prevent playing the cutscene everytime, you can use something unused like ``0x0F`` (https://wiki.cloudmodding.com/oot/Save_Format#event_chk_inf for more informations)
- ``SEGMENT_ADDRESS`` is the important part. This is the memory address where your cutscene is located. Using the ``#include`` will allow you to use the name of the array containing the cutscene commands in the file you exported you're cutscene, if you named the cutscene object ``Cutscene.YOUR_CS_NAME`` then this array will be named ``YOUR_CS_NAME``, use that name for the segment address.
3. Example with: ``{ ENTR_SPOT00_3, 2, EVENTCHKINF_A0, gHyruleFieldIntroCs },``
- ``ENTR_SPOT00_3`` is the Hyrule Field entrance from Lost Woods, see ``entrance_table.h`` to view/add entrances
- ``2`` means this cutscene can be watched as child AND as adult
- ``EVENTCHKINF_A0`` is the flag set in the ``event_chk_inf`` table, this is a macro but you can use raw hex: ``0xA0``
- ``gHyruleFieldIntroCs`` is the name of the array with the cutscene commands, as defined in ``assets/scenes/overworld/spot00_scene.c``, ``CutsceneData gHyruleFieldIntroCs[]``
4. Compile the game again and use the entrance you chose for ``sEntranceCutsceneTable`` and your cutscene should play.

Note that you can have the actual address of your cutscene if you use ``sym_info.py`` from decomp. Example with ``gHyruleFieldIntroCs``:
- Command: ``./sym_info.py gHyruleFieldIntroCs``
- Result: ``Symbol gHyruleFieldIntroCs (RAM: 0x02013AA0, ROM: 0x27E9AA0, build/assets/scenes/overworld/spot00/spot00_scene.o)``

If you have a softlock in-game then you probably did something wrong when creating the cutscene. Make sure you set up the bones properly. The softlock means the game is playing a cutscene but it's probably reading wrong data. Make sure the cutscene is exported, if it's not export it again.
